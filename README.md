- Supports two queries:
  - `users`: Retrieves a list of all users.
  - `user(id: Int!)`: Retrieves a single user by their ID.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used to build the server.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Apollo Server**: Library for building a GraphQL API server.
- **GraphQL**: Query language for APIs.
